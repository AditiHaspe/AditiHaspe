### Hi there,I'm Aditi ğŸ‘‹

I am a student majoring in Computer Engineering. I have an interest in design and developing Web-sites. I have done several courses to make myself well versed with basic concepts and also completed projects. I have recently developed an interest in Machine learning. So I'm currently learning the required skills.
